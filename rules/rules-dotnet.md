# Development Conventions

1. Always use the latest stable version of .NET Core SDK.
2. Use camelCase for local variables and parameters.
3. Use PascalCase for class, interface, and method names.
4. Add XML documentation comments to all public classes and methods.
5. Follow SOLID principles when designing classes and interfaces.
6. Use asynchronous methods (async/await) where possible for I/O operations.
7. Implement error handling with try-catch blocks and log exceptions.
8. Use dependency injection for managing dependencies.
9. Keep controllers thin; move business logic to services.
